    "One way to think about a central bank is that it acts as the “bankers’ bank”. Wells Fargo, Barclays, and many of the other commercial banks that we’re familiar with are regulated and overseen by a given country’s central bank. That’s just a simple way to consider it, but in practice central banks play a much larger role beyond this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving deeper, a central bank is a politically-independent financial institution that is responsible for overseeing the monetary system of a country. This mainly involves doing so by setting interest rates and regulating how much money circulates throughout the economy. Central banks closely monitor and forecast the aforementioned indicators in order to carry out these responsibilities and conduct monetary policy as needed. An important feature of central banks is that they exist independently from the government, meaning the actions they take are not influenced by political pressure nor do they have to go through a congressional body to carry out their policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "While central banks across countries differ slightly in their mandates, for the most part they share a common vision in their functions and responsibilities. For example, these include\n",
    "- Keeping unemployment low\n",
    "- Maintaining price stability while managing a healthy level of inflation\n",
    "- Stimulating the economy in times of recession\n",
    "- Overseeing the commercial banking system and serving as a lender of last resort\n",

    "In English, you can think of the Taylor Rule as a means of prescribing how nominal interest rates should adjust in response to the observed gaps.

    "Another way that we can directly see how the Taylor Rule is related to the Fed’s dual mandate is to make a simplification using what is called **Okun’s Law**. It was proposed in 1962 by Yale professor Arthur Okun who studied the relationship between unemployment and production.\n",

Thus the coefficient is negative, and empirically $C_{okun}$ is approximately 2. By plugging Okun’s Law into our equation for the Taylor Rule we get,  \n",

Therefore we can clearly see how this is captured by the Taylor Rule with Okun’s Law substituted into it.
